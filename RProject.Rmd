Here is some of my project using R. I would love to hear if you found them helpful. Or, if there’s a mistake you find or a suggestion you have, I’d love to hear about those, too.

## Exploration of Rayshader

This project focuses on discovering rayshader features (the 3D Mapping technique in R).

What is Rayshader? rayshader is an open source package for producing 2D and 3D data visualizations in R. rayshader uses elevation data in a base R matrix and a combination of raytracing, spherical texture mapping, overlays, and ambient occlusion to generate beautiful topographic 2D and 3D maps. In addition to maps, rayshader also allows the user to translate ggplot2 objects into beautiful 3D data visualizations.

In this project, we will see different feautures of rayshader, how to combine that with ggplot2 as well as a cool dataset for you to explore!

## Change in Stock market before and After the Pandemic

This project focuses on finding  the differences between different companies within the top 3 of every sector in the S&P 500 to see which company thrives and which company falls after the pandemic. We track its market cap, volume, price per share to see the key differences between these 11 fields.
