## About me:

Right now, I am a senior majoring in Data Science and minoring in Computer Science at Macalester College. For the past year, I have been learning a lot about data while interning as a Quantitative Analyst at VietSeeds Education and Data Analyst at BENIT Vietnam. First and foremost, I have learned how to apply machine learning techniques such as Neural Network, XgBoost, Catboost into the field of finance and in the stock market. Additionally, I have learned the way to find key insights about the data using Python or R, create visualizations, build databases, and how to scrape data from various sites using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Google API. With these skills that I have learned, I hope that I can land a full-time data analyst job in the future.
