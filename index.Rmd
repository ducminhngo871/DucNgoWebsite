## About me

I am a highly motivated and results-driven Marketing Data Analyst with one year of professional experience. Passionate about leveraging data to drive strategic marketing decisions, I have honed my skills in various tools and technologies, including Python, R Studio, Databricks, SQL, and Microsoft Azure.

As a Marketing Data Analyst, I excel at analyzing large datasets, extracting valuable insights, and translating them into actionable recommendations. My proficiency in Python allows me to develop efficient data pipelines, automate data cleaning and transformation processes, and conduct advanced statistical analyses. With R Studio, I have leveraged my analytical skills to build predictive models and perform data visualization tasks to effectively communicate complex findings.

If you are looking for a Data Analyst who combines technical expertise with a strong business acumen, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to help your organization achieve its strategic marketing goals.

Additionally, I also post my personal project as well as visualizations that I have created in the  Projects and Tidy Tuesday section. Check it out!
