For the past year, I have been learning a lot about data while interning as a Quantitative Analyst at VietSeeds Education and Data Analyst at BENIT Vietnam. First and foremost, I have learned how to apply machine learning techniques such as Neural Network, XgBoost, Catboost into the field of finance and in the stock market. Additionally, I have learned the way to find key insights about the data using Python or R, create visualizations, build databases, and how to scrape data from various sites using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Google API. With these skills that I have learned, I hope that I can land a full-time data analyst job in the future.\nEducation:\nData Science Major, Computer Science Minor, 2018-2022\nMacalester College\nInternship experience:\nData Analyst Intern, March 2021- August 2021\nBENIT Vietnam\nQuantitative Analyst Intern, January 2021 – April 2021\nVietSeeds Foundation\nInvestment Banking Intern, November 2019 – January 2020\nMorgan Stanley\nBig Data Intern, May 2019– August 2019\nCMC Telecom\nOr if you are more interested, feel free to see my resume.\n\n\n\n",

Or, if there’s a mistake you find or a suggestion you have, I’d love to hear about those, too.\nExploration of Rayshader\nThis project focuses on discovering rayshader features (the 3D Mapping technique in R).\nWhat is Rayshader? rayshader is an open source package for producing 2D and 3D data visualizations in R. rayshader uses elevation data in a base R matrix and a combination of raytracing, spherical texture mapping, overlays, and ambient occlusion to generate beautiful topographic 2D and 3D maps. In addition to maps, rayshader also allows the user to translate ggplot2 objects into beautiful 3D data visualizations.\nIn this project, we will see different feautures of rayshader, how to combine that with ggplot2 as well as a cool dataset for you to explore!\nHere is the link to the website\nChange in Stock market before and After the Pandemic\nThis project focuses on finding the differences between different companies within the top 3 of every sector in the S&P 500 to see which company thrives and which company falls after the pandemic. We track its market cap, volume, price per share to see the key differences between these 11 fields.\nHere is the link to the website\n\n\n\n",
