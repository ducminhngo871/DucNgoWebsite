Or, if there’s a mistake you find or a suggestion you\nhave, I’d love to hear about those, too.\nS&P 500 Profit Prediction\nFor this project, we try to predict the profitability of the\nS&P500 Companies and pick the company with the highest chance to\ngenerate profit. So far, in 2021, our top 20 companies have the\nprofitability of 47.25%, which is far higher than the normal S&P\n500’s profit of 23.07%.\nYou can check it out here\nMoreover, if you want to see the powerpoint presentation for the\nproject, I also included it below here\nBayesian Finance\nFor this project, we try a different method: using Bayesian Technique\nto predict the earnings of S&P 500 Companies. How will the project\nturn out? You can check it out here\nExploration of Rayshader\nThis project focuses on discovering rayshader features (the 3D\nMapping technique in R).\nWhat is Rayshader? rayshader is an open source package for producing\n2D and 3D data visualizations in R. rayshader uses elevation data in a\nbase R matrix and a combination of raytracing, spherical texture\nmapping, overlays, and ambient occlusion to generate beautiful\ntopographic 2D and 3D maps. In addition to maps, rayshader also allows\nthe user to translate ggplot2 objects into beautiful 3D data\nvisualizations.\nIn this project, we will see different feautures of rayshader, how to\ncombine that with ggplot2 as well as a cool dataset for you to\nexplore!\nHere is the link to the website\nChange in\nStock market before and After the Pandemic\nThis project focuses on finding the differences between different\ncompanies within the top 3 of every sector in the S&P 500 to see\nwhich company thrives and which company falls after the pandemic. We\ntrack its market cap, volume, price per share to see the key differences\nbetween these 11 fields.\nHere is the link to the website\n\n\n\n",
