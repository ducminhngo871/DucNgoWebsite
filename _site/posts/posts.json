Meanwhile, the number of winner remains relatively stable.\n\n\n\n",

We can see that constructor number 6 - ferrari has the highest points of them all.\nRight now, the question I have is that when I try to filter the top constructor and I try to make a geom_col, the graph is not looking great. The reason for that is because we have a lot of constructors and when I filter it, the constructor is really far apart. So how can I do it?\nMoreover, I would love to know the name of the constructors. Is there any way to combine constructor_standings with constructors? I have tried full join but it does not look great.\n\n\n\n",
