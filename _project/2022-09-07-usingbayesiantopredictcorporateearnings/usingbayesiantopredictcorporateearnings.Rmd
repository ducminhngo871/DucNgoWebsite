For this project, our main goal is to analyze and model this data to better improve projections for a company’s future earnings. We took a Bayesian approach to tackle a situation: predicting the future earnings of S&P 500 companies, using previous earnings and sales. We explore a few Bayesian hierarchical models, as well as a SARIMA model using the bayesforcast package to try and identify one that can provide insight and better predictions for future company’s earnings. 

How will the project turn out? You can check it out [here](https://nolan-meyer.github.io/bayesian-finance/)
