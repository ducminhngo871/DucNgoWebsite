COVID-19 is a devastating pandemic. Firstly thought of as a common flu in Wuhan, China, the pandemic has spread around the world, with more than 100 million cases and more than 2.5 million deaths. It has changed our perspective in multiple areas, however, in this blog post, we focus specifically on its impact on companies and sectors in the US stock market. We will see what are the changes in stock price, in market capitalization as well as how each sector has changed after the pandemic.
